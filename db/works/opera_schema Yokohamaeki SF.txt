synopsis: “In a world where Yokohama Station, which was programmed to multiply itself to secure a base during the Winter War, is out of control, Honshu has fallen and its tentacles are reaching out to Hokkaido and Kyushu, there are two types of people: those who have Suica and can freely walk around Ekinka, and those who do not have Suica. The protagonist, one of these ‘have-nots’, lives in the waste from the station, when a mysterious person called ‘Professor’ gives him an ‘18 Ticket’ that allows him to stay legally in Ekinka for five days. (gomibon nante nai) I want this ‘18-ticket’ to free mankind from the domination of <Yokohama Station>.

Japan was ruled by the self-perpetuating <Yokohama Station>. Ekinka society is controlled by Suika implanted in the brain. Hiroto, who lives outside of this society, relying on waste, is given a ‘mission’ by a man who has been expelled from Ekinka to take charge of the future of humanity. (cover)”
