Synopsis: |
  The novel explores the hidden corners of a dystopian Caracas, crafting the final stage where Morel, Santiago, and Julio gather to liberate themselves from a grotesque, subverted reality turned apocalypse. The ruins of the Tower of Clausura serve as a prison for subhuman creatures, who survive by following orders from shadowy rulers inhabiting the upper floors.
  The Tower of Clausura stands as a watchtower, imprisoning its inhabitants in disused elevator shafts, abandoned air ducts filled with giant rats, and dark recesses of decay. Only Santiago—a strange, vampire-like blue-skinned rodent donning a hero’s cape (or perhaps a pair of bat wings)—dares to confront the clandestine forces that dominate through terror and misery.
  Together, Santiago, Julio, and Morel organize one final competition that is a desperate gamble for freedom, identity, and the reclamation of an existence that may no longer even be real.
