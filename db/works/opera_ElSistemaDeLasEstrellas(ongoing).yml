Sinossi: Two hundred years after a climate catastrophe wiped out much of Earth’s population, Goma, a boy from a working-class family, is born. Among the survivors, a war of all against all erupted. The victors redesigned the world based on the rule of Absolute Difference, which states that being a millionaire means to control reproduction and death. Now, money truly makes a difference. The advantage of being wealthy goes beyond the possession of material goods. The rich take no risks; they adopt children from extensive catalogs of newborns and enjoy long lives by freeing themselves from their bodies, connecting their brains to "life movies"—an endless series of violent and sexual adventures. At the opposite end of this society, the working-class lives by selling their offspring. Goma knows that the only way to escape poverty is to become an actor in the life movies, though the real challenge will be surviving the rigorous actor training.
