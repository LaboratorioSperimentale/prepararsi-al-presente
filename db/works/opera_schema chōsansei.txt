Synopsis: |
   “In 2092, most young women in Japan died as a result of the spread of the smida flu, which originated in bats. In order to halt the declining birth rate, a ‘conscription system’ was adopted by referendum, in which adult males were required to undergo a temporary sex change to encourage pregnancy and childbirth. What is society as seen from the perspective of five men (and women) who are subjected to a ‘conscription system’? (Gomibon nante ai)”
