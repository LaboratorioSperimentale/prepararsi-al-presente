Synopsis: |
  The world as we knew it has vanished after the Great Blackout, water wars, and environmental catastrophes. Days swing from freezing to scorching within hours, animals and nature are nearly extinct, and only a few people have survived. In this desolate present, a group of women live confined within the House of the Sacred Brotherhood, subjected to the will of a religious cult.
  One of them secretly writes this story, night after night, so that one day someone will know what happens within those walls. Tortures, sacrifices, and terrifying ceremonies are carried out in the name of enlightenment. They are ruled by the strict authority of the Mother Superior, beneath only Him. But who is He? Little is known; no one can see Him, yet He rules from the shadows.
