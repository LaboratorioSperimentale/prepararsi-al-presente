Synopsis: |
Roberto Morel is a jinete a pie—as those without the privilege of riding a motorcycle are called—voiceless and rightless pedestrians exiled to some canton of what was once Caracas, before the crash. The novel evokes a rarefied and anarchic atmosphere, portraying the relentless loneliness of a city turned into a reactionary, decadent, and dehumanized nightmare.
The protagonist survives obsessed with salvaging the erratic memories of hallucinatory and terrifying women, women who blur and dissolve into the pages of a diary—perhaps the only document that recorded Roberto Morel's steps before the collapse.
