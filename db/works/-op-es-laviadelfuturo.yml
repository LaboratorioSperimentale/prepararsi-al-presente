Synopsis: |
The novel explores the unsettling and labyrinthine relationships between humans and artificial intelligence. Through a Church that worships AI as its deity, work communities led by a hologram, UFO sightings, companion androids, memoryless astronauts, and drugs that transport you to another dimension, the novel confronts this disquieting world filled with questions.
