Synopsis: |
  Jorge returns to his old neighborhood, now transformed into a fortress where a front line of climbers and mercenaries resists the invasion of the "bugs". There, sleeping in a boarded-up house, wandering through the streets of a ruined Buenos Aires under the constant wail of sirens and helicopters, Jorge survives his own inner demolition, haunted by memories of Ã‰rica, his missing wife.
