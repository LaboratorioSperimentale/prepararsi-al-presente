Synopsis: |
  Sarajevo once again becomes the centre of world history when a homemade atomic bomb destroys it. As democratic states turn more and more into states where ‘Absolute Surveillance’ is the norm and the flight to a vague ‘Total Security’ drives to dictatorship, Clavis Shepard, an American intelligence agent, sets out on the trail of the criminal mastermind behind the attack. John Paul is the man responsible for the chaos into which the world is plunging. But who is this man? Where is he hiding? And is he really responsible for what is happening? Or is he just another pawn in yet another game of mirrors? (animeclick)
