Synopsis: |
Villa Miserias is an ordinary city in an unspecified Latin American country, and Max Michels is a man at odds with power and its new ideology called "quietism in motion." He is a man in perpetual conflict with every form of authority, with his love for Nelly LÃ³pez, and with his own mind and its many demons.
