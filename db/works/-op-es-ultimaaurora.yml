Synopsis: |
Many cyborgs had never managed to achieve freedom or obtain a certificate granting them independence from the Empire. Only Itókrides had. And it was all thanks to Agh'lana, who had become his protector from the very moment she found him wandering among the garbage heaps of Sludge District, madness hidden in his eyes. Agh'lana healed him and taught him how to survive on the streets. From that moment on, Agh'lana's enemies were Itókrides' enemies. Anyone who dared touch her, hurt her, or pursue her was doomed to die. (back cover)
