Synopsis: |
  In a near-present world where people can escape to another dimension called “the phosphorescence,” two siblings, Rapo and Masita, strive to flee from the dull and insubstantial reality they inhabit through a dangerous game of vanishing and reappearing. When Rapo disappears into the phosphorescence, Masita is compelled to set off on a journey to bring him back to the present, encountering along the way a parade of characters who defy the rules of reality and blur the boundary between both worlds, all fugitives from a crumbling reality.
