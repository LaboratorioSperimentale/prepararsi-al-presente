Synopsis: |
  Federico Stahl is dead. Or at least that’s what they say.
  While researching the special edition of Stahl’s first album, Valeria, an expert on all things related to the enigmatic and vanished artist, embarks on a journey across the Argentine pampa, through the ruins of Invierno de la Bomba, and into contact with LEO13000, a supercomputer shrouded in mystery.
