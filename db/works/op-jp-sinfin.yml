Synopsis: |
  In 2070, a new form of eternal life has become the crowning achievement of our civilization. The Chinese word pronounced tsian—meaning paradise—is the invention that the great Samar offered to the world, transforming the lives and deaths of billions. But beyond the official mythology, no one knows its true story. Sinfín begins in a small village in the Patagonian jungle, a remote place frozen in time where sickness, old age, and death still exist. There begins the search for the woman who will reveal the real story: the silenced human sacrifices, hidden agendas, and the circumstances that enabled the most astonishing leap in human technology, in a world unraveling amidst religious wars and endless migrations.
