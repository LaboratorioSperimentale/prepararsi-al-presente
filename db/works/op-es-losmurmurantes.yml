Synopsis: |
  Set in a post-apocalyptic Ecuador overrun by zombies—creatures born of procreation and infection—the remnants of humanity struggle to survive as these beings destroy all that remains alive. Quito has fractured into two fortified camps, one ruled by the successors of an ultraconservative religious community, Mundus Dei, and the other controlled by a Jesuit-inspired soldierly order. (by Iván Rodrigo Mendizábal, Trans. from Spanish)
