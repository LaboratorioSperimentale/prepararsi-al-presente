Synopsis: |
In Bestia, love, science fiction, and horror intertwine in a futuristic and distorted universe. Olave, a storyteller and poet, is the center of the plot, a muse whose imagination becomes an object of desire and control. In this cyberpunk world, a technocrat known as Barba Azul hides dark secrets behind the mystical golden key door, while a cyborg stalks in his role as a ruthless assassin, obsessed with his creator and goddess, Olave.
As reality fractures into dreams and nightmares, the reader traverses a landscape marked by extreme technology, violence, and the loss of humanity. The novel becomes an exploration of creativity as a commodity, love as a driving force, and survival as an impossibility in a setting of destruction and chaos.
With echoes of fairy tales transformed into horrors, Bestia immerses us in a story filled with mystery, psychological terror, and twisted beauty, where the magical and the technological merge into a portrait of cruelty and poetry. (back cover)
