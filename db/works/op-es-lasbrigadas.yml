Synopsis: |
   Brigadas by Ariel Luppino is a dystopian novel set in a pandemic-stricken Buenos Aires, transformed into a nightmarish detention center. A mysterious disease, supposedly transmitted by rats, creates chaos, marked by grotesque symptoms like skin marks and linguistic disturbances. The story unfolds through the eyes of a nameless detainee in a brutal prison overseen by the psychopathic “Milico”, who enforces dehumanizing tasks, experiments on inmates, and perpetuates a reign of terror.
