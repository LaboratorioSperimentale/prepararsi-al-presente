Sinossi: |
  In the world, all safe spaces have become scarce. The city, family, and personal projects follow a logic that no one quite understandsâ€”how it all ties together or how to navigate it. The characters seem to grasp some of the strangeness surrounding them and put up some resistance or form a plan, yet they mostly allow themselves to be absorbed by the world they live in. Existence has become a puzzle impossible to piece back together, and empty spaces are filled with unexpected things. The fear of emptiness is the golden rule, yet everyone accepts and contributes to filling it in the vaguest way, as if emptied of horror.
