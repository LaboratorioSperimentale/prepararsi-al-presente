Synopsis: |
In a nameless city, a group of disenchanted young people start a back-to-nature movement. They abandon their children and retreat to live in the forests. Some time later, the local deer begin to behave strangely and aggressively.
América Alucinada tells the story of three characters. Berenice, a young girl seemingly abandoned by her mother; Beryl, an elderly ex-hippie who starts a hunting club to eliminate the deer; and Vik, an immigrant who discovers a woman has been hiding in his house for days.
