Synopsis: |
Matrix acelerada is an accelerationist reading of the Matrix saga, opening new speculative horizons. Here, David Bowie, sonic posthumanism, and radical ideas challenge the well-worn notion of a "frozen present," where all futures seemed canceled. Yet, in an era of metaverses, automation, and artificial intelligence, this reanimated future may belong to the machines.
