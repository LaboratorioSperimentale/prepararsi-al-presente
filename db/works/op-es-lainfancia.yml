Synopsis: |
   La infancia del mundo is a cyberpunk exploration of a climate-ravaged future set in Argentinaâ€™s "Pampean Caribbean," a region transformed after the Antarctic ice melts in 2197. The story follows Dengue Boy, a humanoid mosquito ostracized for his monstrous appearance, as he navigates a world reshaped by ecological and social collapse. Telepathic stones unearthed by the melting ice become objects of smuggling and ancient wisdom, while a planetary engineering corporation seeks to redesign Earth and other planets for tourism. Blending socio-environmental critique with elements of body horror and science fiction, the novel questions whether the same capitalist systems that destroyed nature can rebuild it, juxtaposing a dystopian reality with the escapism of virtual worlds.
