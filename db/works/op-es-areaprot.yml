Synopsis: |
   The novel envisions a near-future world on the brink of apocalypse, where Earth's final days are marked by blurred boundaries between human bodies and holographic projections. Despite the inevitability of the end, characters cling to hope, seeking meaning beyond life. The Protected Area, a refuge once for the privileged, becomes a battleground between the Community—a group blending spirituality, veganism, and astrology to confront the climate crisis—and a government allied with powerful corporations. With themes of technology, environmental collapse, and extraterrestrial life, the novel explores humanity’s resilience and conflict, offering a chilling yet reflective look at how we respond to existential threats in an increasingly mediated world.
