Synopsis: |
 The novel unfolds in a near future or alternate present. The collapse of communications and widespread technological failure leave the world grappling with unsettling and distressing rumors about events across the globe. Fragmented, contradictory, and speculative information hints at abject hypotheses. The first verified report confirms a cataclysm. Days later, the impossible is confirmed: Portugal's capital has been devastated.
News of the tragedy deepens the disquiet in a Venezuela already ruined and degraded by militarism. Amid collective despair, a lack of information, and the (legitimate) fear of an impending apocalypse, a high school teacher struggles to sustain his students' interest in the arts, life, and freedom.
The novel serves as a metaphor for the world's destruction, the contrast between the physical annihilation of one country and the moral collapse of another. The novel is both the failed (but tireless) epic of Venezuelan students suffocated by tyranny and a romantic dialogue with Portuguese literature, embodied in the melancholic and endearing figure of the elderly Moreira.
