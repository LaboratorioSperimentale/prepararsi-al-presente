Synopsis: |
   A world on the brink of disaster, where children with new attitudes are awakening with strange new abilities - but can they change the course of history in time to save the human race? Yuri, a 17-year-old girl, is starting in a new high school where she hopes to re-commence a normal student life. But when she witnesses an unusual classmate, Tengo, get struck by a car and walk away unscathed, she decides to reveal her secrets. What makes Yuri special has, however, not gone unnoticed by The Complex, a shadowy organisation that has been hunting her and will not stop until they discover the source of her powers. She will need the help of Tengo and his gifted misfit friends to escape The Complex's control and help realise the destiny of Generation Alpha. In Monkey Man, translated by Lisa and Daniel Lilley, Takuji Ichikawa, one of Japan's most imaginative, bestselling and unusual authors, creates a page-turning story about the children of tomorrow who will be called on to heal the world from spiritual and environmental decay.
