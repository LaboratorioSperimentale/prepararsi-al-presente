Synopsis: |
Humanity is depicted as immersed in a new society called the "Productive Society." This collective is built on technological advancement, the development of genetic studies, and human cloning. The system is totalitarian and rigid, intolerant of inefficient individuals, who are commonly referred to as "Unproductive."
This novel tells the story of a productive individual, an employee in a stock exchange building, who one day witnesses the strange disappearance of a young productive woman. This event awakens his consciousness, gradually leading him to lose his sense of belonging in the "Productive Society." He escapes, embarking on a journey to discover his true destiny, uncovering something that had been hidden for a long time.
