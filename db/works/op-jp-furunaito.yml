Synopsis: "In the distant future, planet Earth is a place covered in thick clouds and no longer as bright as it once was, a world where plants are dead and oxygen is running out. In this hostile environment, humans have survived by developing technology that turns them into plants that produce a small amount of oxygen. People are faced with a choice: whether to live as people in an uncertain world or to abandon suffering and embark on a new life as plants."
