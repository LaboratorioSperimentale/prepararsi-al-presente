synopsis: “Nowatari Rui is a woman tired of being the subject of the novels of her husband, a celebrated writer who sees her only as a source of inspiration for his art. Stripped of her identity and private life, Rui is invaded by a feeling of frustration and, in a moment of despondency, ingests an entire bowl of seeds that begin to sprout all over her body. The woman-plant slowly transforms into a tangle of roots and strands, until she becomes a forest that will engulf the entire neighborhood and her husband himself, in a metamorphosis of freedom.
