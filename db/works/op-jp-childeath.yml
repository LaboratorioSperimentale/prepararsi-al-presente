Synopsis: |
   It is the future, and Earth has long given up on mankind and become able to produce witches - beings that have the sole purpose of killing humans. The Time Witch placed a curse on all of humanity that dooms everyone to die the moment they become an adult. As such, children are now the only remaining life on Earth. But there are various other witches who seek to take even the lives of those children, and despite more and more children dying each day, there's one girl who hasn't given up on the idea of launching a counterattack against the witches...?! Blood and flesh are sent flying in this atrociously cruel fantasy! Source: Hakusensha
