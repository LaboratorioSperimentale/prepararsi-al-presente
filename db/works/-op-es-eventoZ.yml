Synopsis: |
A mysterious pandemic spreads across the globe. A transatlantic ship docks in the harbor of Valparaíso, where a tourist collapses dead on the streets of the port—only to rise again and bite the firefighters who try to help him.
The zombie apocalypse unfolds slowly, creeping and silent, before exploding right under the noses of authorities who fail to declare a state of emergency in time.
In the midst of the chaos, Javier, a 14-year-old student, tries to make it home by implementing the zombie contingency plan he had been perfecting during recess with Weipin, his best friend.
On the other side of the city, Claudia, an executive at a multinational company, flees her workplace alongside Shannon and Pedro, two colleagues she barely knows. Together, they fight to reach Valparaíso and survive the relentless hordes of the ravenous undead.
