Synopsis: |
	The literary adventure of a book club soon becomes a means of escaping the daily anguish of this Caribbean dystopia. A first accidental crime turns the protagonists into accomplices, and the reading of a self-help book transforms them into murderers. The unsettling question that implicitly runs through these pages is whether every woman, in our impunitive and machista societies, harbors a latent desire for revengeâ€”whether every woman has an unresolved crime. The novel also explores the therapeutic value of literature, the many forms of desire, and the moral deceit of self-help books.
