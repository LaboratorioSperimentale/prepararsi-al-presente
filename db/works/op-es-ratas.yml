Synopsis: |
	Aparicio Daza is a bureaucrat working for the presidency. His office, nearly engulfed in darkness, is filled with dust and dampness. One day, he is visited by Ninel Tillería, a woman on a mission to find papers containing crucial information. Daza’s life and career depend on keeping the contents of those papers secret, but Ninel will stop at nothing—absolutely nothing—to obtain them. As the two face off, monstrous rats listen intently from the pipes, lurking in the shadows.
