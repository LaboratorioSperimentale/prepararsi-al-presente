Synopsis: |
  Hundreds of years have passed since humanity was brought to the brink of extinction by the Gadolls, an unknown life form. The survivors, 10% of the former population, live in the Deca-Dence, a 300-metre-high mobile fortress powered by Oxyone, a green liquid that flows in the Gadolls. The inhabitants of Deca-Dence are divided into two categories, Gears, warriors who fight daily against the Gadolls to protect humanity, killing them with the double purpose of procuring meat for the population's sustenance and Oxyone as fuel; - Tankers, those who have no fighting skills and devote themselves to various activities in the fortress, serving the Gears. Natsume has always dreamed of following in her late father's footsteps and becoming a warrior; but her application is not accepted and she is assigned to the maintenance/cleaning of the outer armour. At her new workplace, the energetic and crazy girl meets her grumpy new boss Kaburagi. The future of the world will be totally shaken by this encounter between a girl with an optimistic character who does not give up on her dreams and a cynical man who has already abandoned his.
