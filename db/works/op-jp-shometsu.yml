Synopsis: |
   In Japan in the near future, sexuality and reproduction are completely disconnected. Sex is rarely practised, sexual desire is handled through masturbation and childbirth is only possible through artificial insemination. Married couples are mere vessels to nurture their children, and their respective love interests are directed towards two-dimensional characters or lovers created outside the home. After marrying in a world where this is ‘normal’, Ameon decides to move with her husband to an experimental city in Chiba, Japan. There, people are selected by lottery to become ‘mothers’, and both men and women are artificially inseminated to conceive and raise their children as ‘kodo-chan’, or ‘children’, in the community. (Gomibon nante nai)
