Synopsis: |
  In a country ravaged by plague, the protagonist of this dystopian fable escapes the hospital for terminal patients where he had been confined and embarks on a harrowing journey. He eventually reaches a barren wasteland, resembling the icy mountains of the moon, which reminds him of the rugged terrain where he spent the early years of his life.
