   “In the near future, sisters Enna and Yayako live in a walled city where all forms of communication and surveillance are controlled by a social network called “Kizuna-Topia.” The city is tainted by numerous crimes including the serial abductions of several children whose brains are removed and whose bodies are then resold. The events have triggered a full-scale manhunt, led by the Jikei, the local police; thwarting it is a mysterious entity known only by the name “Witch.” Enna, Yayako and the other residents find themselves trapped within this constant conflict.
