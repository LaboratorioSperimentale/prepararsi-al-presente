Sinossi: A couple survives in the heart of Capital City, though they don’t feel it’s a home. Marina, the narrator, is the granddaughter of a Peruvian immigrant and works in the archives of the Museum of Natural and Social History, while Pascale carries the legacy of his Lafkenche family from Chilco Island in the country’s south, making a living through carpentry. Their best friend, Leila, had to leave Haiti to try her luck in this country, which is steadily marching toward its own destruction. The collapse of a building on Gran Avenida, sinkholes appearing without explanation, and a social movement determined to tear everything down are signs of a seemingly irreversible decay, while the couple and their friend organize and fight for a more dignified existence. At this point, Marina and Pascale decide to migrate to Chilco, where the promise of a fuller life seems possible, far from the colonial exploitation and violence of the Capital.
