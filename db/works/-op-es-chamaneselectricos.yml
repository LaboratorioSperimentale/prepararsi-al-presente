Synopsis: |
Year 5540 of the Andean calendar. Noa and her best friend, Nicole, flee their hometown of Guayaquil to attend the Ruido solar, a massive festival that, for eight days and seven nights, brings together thousands of young people—musicians, dancers, poets, and shamans—at the base of one of the many volcanoes in the Andes. Leaving behind their families and the violence of the cities, they enter a surreal landscape vibrating to the rhythm of music and volcanic eruptions under a meteor-streaked sky. For Noa, this is only the first stop on a journey to reunite with the father who abandoned her as a child and has been living for years in the high forests—a mysterious region also said to shelter the disappeared, those who once attended the Ruido and never returned home.
