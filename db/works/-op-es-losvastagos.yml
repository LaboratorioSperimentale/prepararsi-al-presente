Synopsis: |
In a distant future, after the dreaded nuclear holocaust that devastated Earth, humanity begins to flourish once again, though very slowly. Nearly all scientific knowledge has been lost, leading to the creation of centers dedicated solely to generating new knowledge. But the world easily forgets. Thus, the last of these centers, located on a remote island in the southern seas, the Order of the Kutb, survives in the shadows.
For centuries, this is the only reality for the Kutb, unquestioned and accepted. Until one is born who gazes at the sky and asks, What lies Beyond the Sea? This solitary genius will abruptly uncover the repressive power of a mysterious political system, placing his life in grave danger. What he does not yet know—and will risk death to discover—is that the key to changing his reality, and that of the rest of humanity, lies within his mind.
