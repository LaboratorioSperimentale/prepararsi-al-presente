Synopsis: |
A maximum-security prison built next to the Andes mountain range by the far-right triumvirate governing a decaying Argentina since 2018. Officially declared "drug-free," the prison is ruled by a psychopathic warden who supplies everyone with cocaineâ€”until the National Punitive Service decides to sever all ties between the prison and drug trafficking. This sparks a horrific, widespread riot which, after a fleeting miracle, forces the warden to turn to the most feared and respected figure within his domain.
