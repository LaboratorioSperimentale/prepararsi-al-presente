Synopsis: |
 Ornamento tells the story of an encounter between a scientist and a group of female volunteers who serve as guinea pigs to test a new recreational drug that only affects women. Among them is a special case: a peculiar woman known only as Number 4, who becomes romantically involved with the scientist and his wife, a prestigious artist grappling with a creative crisis.
Number 4's intrusion into the couple's lives has a devastating and corrosive effect on their certainties, built from a position of social and economic privilege.
