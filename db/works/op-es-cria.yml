Synopsis: |
   In the year 2051, Western capitalism is suffocating under the dominance of China, now the world's leading superpower. It is the golden age of quantum computing and genetic engineering. In Argentina, an artificial swamp hides the laboratory of Dr. Mei Hóng, an expert in binary cloning and a terrorist for 'Free China'. Together with her Argentinian lover, Alejandro Stellke, a bibliomaniacal analyst from the National Intelligence Archive, they orchestrate a global conspiracy involving mysterious eggs. Participants include American ornithologist Kurt Sealow; a necrophilic agent of the Vatican secret service; the commander of a clandestine army obsessed with Perón; young Chinese conjoined twins; and Chico Eisen, a field agent trained from childhood by Stellke himself.
