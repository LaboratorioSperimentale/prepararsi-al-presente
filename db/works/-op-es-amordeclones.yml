Synopsis: |
The novel delves into a possible near future through an ingenious action-filled plot, that is to say the world of clones. Kira and Mel, identical copies of a film diva, face the challenge of differentiating themselves to achieve the longed-for sense of otherness. Each takes an opposite path, yet their journeys only highlight the inescapable bond between them. (Back cover)
