synopsis: "In the heath of ‘Terra’, natural disasters of unknown causes occurred irregularly in many areas. Therefore, most people, in order to escape those disasters, went to live in mobile cities that developed over the years. The Originium that poured into the site of those catastrophes led to the rapid progress of civilisation thanks to their immense energy. But it also brought with it something else: an incurable disease called oripathy. As the bodies of people with oripathy gradually crystallise and become a new source of infection at the moment of death, in many countries the infected are subjected to persecution in segregation regimes and forced labour. Those who were oppressed by governments begin to rebel. Rhodes Island, a pharmaceutical company in search of a cure, takes up arms and begins a conquest trying to save the population from the disease."
