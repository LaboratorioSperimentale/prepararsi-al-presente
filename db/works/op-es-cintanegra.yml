Synopsis: |
Cinta negra is a hilariously sharp parody of the corporate world and the pursuit of social mobility. It sketches out how some corporations foster cult-like structures within, where reaching the top of the chain of command is akin to ascending to the heavens.
The "black belt‚Äù is the highest professional honor one can aspire to within Soluciones, a hyper-modern company devoted to "solutioneering" bespoke solutions. This is a booming service in an era of boundless inventiveness.
