Synopsis: |
  Due to a virus that affects animals and infects humans, the world has become an inhospitable place, with society divided between human beings who eat and human beings who are eaten. The main character, Marcos Tejo lives among the loss of his father who developed a dementia after the spread of the zoonosis, the loss of his beloved child, the end of his marriage with Cecilia, the loss of his pets, and the unbearable weight of his job in the slaughterhouse in which now are human beings who are killed and processed. In this inhuman scenario, he finds a momentary emotional balance having an illegal affair with a 'head', named Jazmín, that he adopts and tries to re-humanize. Nonetheless, Marcos and Cecilia, silently during the novel, are gradually forced to adapt their lives to the new order of society and they kill Jazmín, adopting her son, leaving unexplained the real reason of the murder.
