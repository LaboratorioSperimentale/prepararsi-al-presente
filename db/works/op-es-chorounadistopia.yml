Synopsis: |
Venezuela, 2021. Eight years after the death of Comandante Choro, the utopia he promised has crumbled, leaving one of Latin America's wealthiest countries transformed into a lawless wasteland. Food, water, and fuel are scarce; communication networks have collapsed, and air traffic is restricted. Armed gangs roam the land, looting and killing anyone in their path. Many survive by scavenging waste, leading to mutations that turn them into zombies.
Those who remain sane desperately seek escape, but with borders sealed, fleeing seems impossible. Amid this chaos, a privileged "sifrino" from Caracas has survived by becoming a skilled gunslinger. His goal is to board a clandestine ferry to leave behind the ruined land, overrun by strange and savage creatures doomed to extinction. The plan seems straightforward until he meets Natalia, an idealistic and rebellious young woman who shatters his indestructible cowboy persona, forcing him to rethink his escape. (goodreads)
