Synopsis: |
  The novel explores strategies of survival and transformation in a post-apocalyptic world reshaped by a “Great Flood”. Humanity, fragmented into nomadic clans, undergoes physical and societal reconfigurations, symbolizing a breakdown and renewal of individuality and collective identity. Central to the novel is the “memory of the species”, a primal, collective knowledge tied to human and non-human forms, emphasizing adaptability and becoming.
